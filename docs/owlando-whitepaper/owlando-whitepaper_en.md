## 1. Introduction
Owlando is a social game based on Web3D and ERC4907 NFTs, aimed at creating a new game ecosystem. In Owlando, players can create their own game content and turn it into NFTs. These NFTs can serve as digital certificates for players' game ideas and can be traded in-game and on the blockchain. 

Owlando provides a user-generated content (UGC) system and a game content platform, allowing players to use the game editor to create their own game content and publish it to the game content platform. These game content can be purchased and used by other players and can also be turned into NFTs for trading on the blockchain. 

Protecting users' intellectual property rights is a key feature of Owlando. In Owlando, players can turn their game ideas into NFTs and protect them through smart contracts. This ensures that players' game ideas are not stolen or copied, and can be turned into valuable digital assets. 

Another goal of Owlando is to provide players with diverse sources of income. Players can earn income through the sale of game content and trading of NFTs. In addition, Owlando will also provide special game activities and contests, which will offer players more opportunities for income. 

In summary, Owlando is an innovative and forward-looking game ecosystem that combines gaming and blockchain technology. It provides a secure, fair, and sustainable gaming environment, bringing unique social gaming experiences to global gaming enthusiasts, and providing them with a new and diversified source of income. We believe that Owlando will become a Killer APP leading the development of the gaming industry, creating long-term value for investors and users.

## 2. Background
With the continuous evolution of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, NFTs have become a new trend in the digital asset field and have been widely used in the gaming industry. The unique identity and ownership attributes of NFTs allow players to truly own their game assets and conduct transactions and sales outside of the game, bringing new possibilities to the gaming industry. However, the closure of some games may cause players to lose their game assets and emotional attachment, making players consider the security and value protection of their game assets. In this context, Owlando uses blockchain technology and the characteristics of NFTs to provide players with a more secure, trustworthy, and valuable gaming platform, allowing players to have better experiences and returns in both gaming and blockchain domains.

## 3. Goal and Purpose

### 3.1. Provide a secure, trustworthy, and valuable gaming platform
Owlando will use blockchain technology and NFTs to provide players with a more secure, trustworthy, and valuable gaming platform. By protecting the ownership and usage rights of game assets, players can truly own their game assets and conduct transactions and sales outside of the game.

## 4. Analysis

With these technologies, we can protect users' game ideas and designs and turn them into unique NFT assets that can be traded and sold on the platform. Additionally, we will provide a UGC gaming system that allows users to create their own game content and share and communicate with other users.

In the current gaming industry, the phenomenon of the killer app is evident, and good high-quality games can stand out. We believe that high-quality social games can emerge in Web3D engines.

## 6. Our Market and Competitive Advantages
The Owlando platform will target the global market of game enthusiasts, especially players who enjoy creating and sharing game content. We believe that by providing a secure, transparent, and innovative gaming ecosystem, we will be able to attract more and more players to our community.
Our competitive advantages will include the following aspects:

### 6.1. Content Protection Based on NFTs
The main reason why Owlando uses the ERC-4907 NFT protocol is to protect users' creativity and content. The ERC4907 protocol has various functions, including NFT leasing and NFT sales, which can help users protect their game ideas and designs. Through NFT leasing, Owlando's users can temporarily lease their creative game assets to other users, enabling sharing and collaboration. Leasing can also help users generate more income. Furthermore, by selling NFTs, users can convert their creative assets into Owlando Tokens, which allows for broader circulation and trading of assets.
In addition, the ERC4907 protocol is scalable and interoperable, allowing for seamless integration with other NFT protocols and platforms. This provides Owlando with more flexibility and freedom to better meet users' needs and expectations.
Owlando chose to use the ERC4907 NFT protocol to protect users' creativity and content, and to take advantage of protocol functions and features to provide users with a better experience and value.

### 6.2. UGC System and Game Platform
The Owlando UGC (User-Generated Content) system is a social UGC game-building platform based on Web3D game engines that allows users to collaboratively create game scenes and unleash team creativity. The system has the following advantages:

#### Security and Anti-Counterfeiting
Owlando uses the ERC 4907 NFT protocol to ensure that the digital assets created by users are unique and can be traced and proven for ownership. This effectively protects users' creative content from piracy and illegal copying.

#### Social-based Creative Sharing and Building
The Owlando UGC system allows users to share their digital creative assets and invite others to collaborate in building game scenes, which helps improve creative efficiency and levels.

#### Cross-Platform Features
The Owlando UGC system's web-based game engine building platform is cross-platform, allowing users to create and share game content on any device. This means that users are not limited to specific devices or operating systems, providing greater flexibility and convenience. Cross-platform features also provide creative game builders with a wider market and opportunities, making it easier for them to bring their game masterpieces to the global market.

#### Scalability and Interoperability
Owlando's use of ERC 4907 NFT protocol + Web3D UGC design is scalable and interoperable, allowing for seamless integration with other NFT protocols and platforms to enhance system flexibility and freedom.
