# What is Owlando?
Owlando is a Web3D-based NFT social game, aiming to create a brand new game ecosystem. In Owlando, players can create their own game content and turn it into NFT. These NFTs serve as digital certificates for players' game ideas and can be traded both in-game and on the blockchain.

We encourage users to build high-quality game content, and we protect and encourage users' game ideas
